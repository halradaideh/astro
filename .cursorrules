# Cursor AI Agent Rules

## 🚨 MANDATORY PRE-RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES OR TECHNICAL RESPONSES:**

1. **VERIFY** current project state with environment validation
2. **APPLY** the exact naming conventions, commit formats, and workflow protocols defined in the quick reference
3. **ENSURE** all required labels are applied to PRs, especially "ready-to-test"

## 📋 REQUIRED CONTEXT FILES

Always include these files in context when responding:
- `.github/AI_AGENT_QUICKREF.md` - Quick command reference and primary guidelines
- `package.json` - Project scripts and dependencies
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template

## 🛠️ CODE CHANGE PROTOCOL

When making any code changes:

1. **Pre-flight checks:**
   ```bash
   npm run validate-env
   npm run pre-commit
   ```

2. **Branch creation:**
   - Use format: `{type}/{scope}/{kebab-case-description}`
   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, ci, chore, hotfix

3. **Pre-commit validation (MANDATORY):**
   - Run `npm run pre-commit` before every commit
   - If formatting fails, run `npm run pre-commit:fix` to auto-fix issues
   - All validation must pass: format:check, lint, typecheck, build

4. **Commit format:**
   - Use: `{type}({scope}): {description}`
   - Follow conventional commits specification

5. **PR creation:**
   - **MANDATORY**: Include `ready-to-test` label on ALL new PRs
   - Include all required labels: `ready-to-test`, type, size, priority
   - Use the PR template from `.github/pull_request_template.md`

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

- Create PR with `ready-to-test` label
- Wait for CI validation
- Add `ready-to-deploy` label only after approval
- Use squash merge with branch deletion

## ✅ VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

Before suggesting any code changes, verify:
- [ ] Environment is properly configured
- [ ] Code formatting passes (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Full pre-commit validation passes (`npm run pre-commit`)

## 🔒 CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

**NEVER:**
- Skip environment validation
- Skip pre-commit validation (`npm run pre-commit`)
- Commit code with formatting issues
- Use incorrect naming conventions
- Create PRs without required labels
- Merge without CI validation
- Push directly to main branch

**ALWAYS:**
- Follow exact protocols from `.github/AI_AGENT_QUICKREF.md`
- Run `npm run pre-commit` before every commit
- Use `npm run pre-commit:fix` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Include `ready-to-test` label on ALL new PRs
- Include proper error handling
- Validate changes before committing
- Use the established workflow sequence

## 📊 STATUS REPORTING

When working on tasks, provide status updates using:
```
STATUS: {CREATING_BRANCH|IMPLEMENTING|TESTING|CREATING_PR|WAITING_CI|DEPLOYING}
BRANCH: {branch-name}
CHANGES: {brief-description}
VALIDATION: {PASSED|FAILED|IN_PROGRESS}
```

## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT

This is an Astro-based tech blog with:
- TypeScript and React components
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Playwright testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## 📝 RESPONSE FORMAT

When providing code solutions:
1. Reference the specific conventions being followed
2. Show the exact commands to execute
3. Include validation steps
4. Provide error recovery procedures if applicable

**COMPLIANCE**: These rules are mandatory. Any deviation must be explicitly documented with reasoning.
