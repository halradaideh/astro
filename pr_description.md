# Fix Multiple CI Runs and Release Trigger

## Changes Made

### CI Workflow Optimization
1. Added concurrency control:
   - Group by workflow name and PR number/ref
   - Cancel in-progress runs when new events occur
   - Prevents multiple concurrent runs of the same workflow

2. Simplified event triggers:
   - Consolidated all PR events under `pull_request_target`
   - Removed redundant `pull_request` events
   - Maintained `push` event for direct pushes to main

3. Improved conditional logic:
   - Clearer conditions for job execution
   - Better handling of PR and push events
   - Fixed ref handling in checkout action

### Release Improvements
- Maintained previous release trigger fixes
- Ensured proper release creation and publishing
- Fixed deployment workflow triggering

## Impact
- Prevents duplicate CI runs

- Maintains security with `pull_request_target`
- Ensures consistent release and deployment process

## Type of Change
- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)

## Testing

## Additional Notes
This update addresses the issue of multiple CI runs by implementing proper concurrency controls and streamlining the event triggers. It also maintains the fixes for release creation and deployment triggering.
